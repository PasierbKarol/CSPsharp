     * The <tt>java.lang.Object.wait</tt> method sometimes returns <i>spuriously</i>
     * - i.e. without being <tt>notify</tt>'d by another thread or <tt>interrupt</tt>ed 
     * or timed-out!  This class is an optional (static) repository holding and reporting
     * counts of any such spurious wakeups.  JCSP handles all spurious wakeups cleanly.
     * <p>
     * Some JVMs also timeout on calls of <tt>wait(timeout)</tt> early.  This class
     * enables the specification of <i>how early</i> will be acceptable to JCSP.
     * <i>``Timeouts''</i> returned earlier than the set threshold are treated as
     * <i>spurious wakeups</i> (i.e. the process is put back to sleep).
     * Provision is also made for counting and reporting the accepted early timeouts.
     * <p>
     * To operate, this logging must first be switched on ({@link #start}).
