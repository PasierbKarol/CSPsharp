     * This is thrown if a process is interrupted whilst blocked during synchronisation
     * - processes should never be interrupted.
     *
     * <H2>Description</H2>
     * This is caused by accessing the Java thread executing a JCSP process and invoking its
     * <TT>java.lang.Thread.interrupt</TT>() method.
     * If this is done to a process blocked on a JCSP synchronisation primitive (such as
     * a channel communication or timeout), the process will wake up prematurely
     * -- invalidating the semantics of that primitive.
     * The wake up is intercepted and this {@link java.lang.Error} is thrown.
     * <P>
     * Some browsers, when shutting down an <I>applet</I>, may do this to processes
     * spawned by an {@link jcsp.awt.ActiveApplet} that have not died naturally.
     *
     * Alternatively, this may be raised by processes stopped prematurely as a result of
     * a call to <TT>Parallel.destroy</TT>, or by calling <TT>stop</TT> on the
     * <TT>ProcessManager</TT> responsible for the process (or network).
