* This enables a process to wait passively for and choose
* between a number of {@link Guard} events.
* <P>
* <A HREF="#constructor_summary">Shortcut to the Constructor and Method Summaries.</A>
* <H2>Description</H2>
* The <code>Alternative</code> class enables a <code>CSProcess</code> to wait passively for and
* choose between a number of {@link Guard} events.  This is known as
* <code>ALT</code><I>ing</I>.
* <P>
* <I>Note: for those familiar with the <I><B>occam</B></I> multiprocessing
* language, this gives the semantics of the </I><code>ALT</code><I> and
* </I><code>PRI</code> <code>ALT</code><I> constructs, extended with a built-in implementation
* of the classical </I><code>FAIR</code> <code>ALT</code><I>.</I>
* <P>
* The <code>Alternative</code> constructor takes an array of guards.  Processes
* that need to <I>Alt</I> over more than one set of guards will need a separate
* <code>Alternative</code> instance for each set.
* <P>
* Six types of <code>Guard</code> are provided in <code>jcsp.lang</code>:
* <UL>
*   <LI>
*      {@link AltingChannelInput}: <I>object channel input</I> --
*      ready if unread data is pending in the channel.
*   <LI>
*      {@link AltingChannelInputInt}: <I>integer channel input</I> --
*      ready if unread data is pending in the channel.
*   <LI>
*      {@link AltingChannelAccept}: <I>CALL channel accept</I> --
*      ready if an unaccepted call is pending on the channel.
*   <LI>
*      {@link AltingBarrier}: <I>barrier synchronisation</I> --
*      ready if all enrolled processes are offering to synchronise.
*   <LI>
*      {@link CSTimer}: <I>timeout</I> --
*      ready if the timeout has expired (timeout
*      values are absolute time values, not delays)
*   <LI>
*      {@link Skip}: <I>skip</I> --
*      always ready.
* </UL>
* <P>
* By invoking one of the following methods, a process may passively wait for
* one or more of the guards associated with an <code>Alternative</code> object
* to become ready.  The methods differ in the way they choose which guard
* to select in the case when two or more guards are ready:
* <UL>
*   <LI>
*      {@link #select() <code>select</code>} waits for one or more of the guards
*      to become ready.  If more than one become ready, it makes an
*      <I>arbitrary</I> choice between them (and corresponds to the
*      <I><B>occam</B></I> <code>ALT</code>).
*   <LI>
*      {@link #priSelect() <code>priSelect</code>} also waits for one or more of
*      the guards to become ready.  However, if more than one becomes ready,
*      it chooses the <I>first</I> one listed (and corresponds to the
*      <I><B>occam</B></I> <code>PRI</code> <code>ALT</code>).  Note: the use of
*      <code>priSelect</code> between channel inputs and a skip guard (at lowest
*      priority) gives us a <I>polling</I> operation on the <I>readiness</I>
*      of those channels.</I>
*   <LI>
*      {@link #fairSelect() <code>fairSelect</code>} also waits for one or more
*      of the guards to become ready.  If more than one become ready, it
*      prioritises its choice so that the guard it chose <I>the last time
*      it was invoked</I> has lowest priority this time.  This corresponds
*      to a common <I><B>occam</B></I> idiom used for real-time applications.
*      If <code>fairSelect</code> is used
*      in a loop, a ready guard has the guarantee that no other guard will be
*      serviced <I>twice</I> before it will be serviced.  This enables
*      an upper bound on service times to be calculated and ensures that no
*      ready guard can be indefinitely starved.
* </UL>
* <P>
* Finally, each guard may be <A HREF="Alternative.html#Wot-no-Chickens">
* <I>pre-conditioned</I></A> with a run-time test
* to decide if it should be considered in the current choice.  This allows
* considerable flexibilty -- for example, we can decide whether timeouts
* shoud be set, channels refused or polling enabled depending
* on the run-time state of the <I>Alting</I> process.
* </P>
* <H2>Examples</H2>
* <H3>A Fair Multiplexor</H3>
* This example demonstrates a process that <I>fairly</I> multiplexes traffic
* from its array of input channels to its single output channel.  No input
* channel will be starved, regardless of the eagerness of its competitors.
* <PRE>

* }
* </PRE>
* Note that if <code>priSelect</code> were used above, higher-indexed guards would be
* starved if lower-indexed guards were continually demanding service -- and
* the timeout would never be noticed.
* If <code>select</code> were used, no starvation analysis is possible.
* <P>
* To demonstrate <code>FairPlexTime</code>, consider:
* <PRE>
* import jcsp.lang.*;
* import jcsp.plugNplay.Printer;
* <I></I>
* class FairPlexTimeTest {
* <I></I>
*   public static void main (String[] args) {
* <I></I>
*     final One2OneChannel[] a = Channel.createOne2One (5);
*     final One2OneChannel b = Channel.createOne2One ();
* <I></I>
*     new Parallel (
*       new CSProcess[] {
*         new Regular (a[0].out (), 0, 5),
*         new Regular (a[1].out (), 1, 5),
*         new Regular (a[2].out (), 2, 5),
*         new Regular (a[3].out (), 3, 5),
*         new Regular (a[4].out (), 4, 5),
*         new FairPlexTime (Channel.getInputArray (a), b.out (), 10000),
*         new Printer (b.in (), "FairPlexTimeTest ==> ", "\n")
*       }
*     ).run ();
* <I></I>
*   }
* <I></I>
* }
* </PRE>
* where <code>Regular</code> (documented as an example in the {@link CSTimer}
* class) attempts to output an <code>Integer</code> (defined by its second parameter) to
* the channel (defined by its first parameter) at a regular interval (defined by its
* third parameter in msecs).  If you are using a relatively slow <I>JVM</I> (such as
* <code>JDK1.1.x</code>), the input channels to <code>FairPlexTime</code> will always be
* ready.  Faster <I>JVM</I>s (such as <code>JDK1.2</code>) are able to clear all input
* channels leaving the timeout guard selectable.  Either way, all channels are
* fairly serviced and the eventual timeout (after 10 seconds) is processed.
* <P>
* If <code>FairPlexTime</code> had used <code>alt.priSelect</code> instead of
* <code>alt.fairSelect</code> and a slow <I>JVM</I> is used, the higher indexed channels
* would not get serviced and neither would the timeout.  Try it and see!  Notice
* the different behaviour if you freeze screen output (with <I>ctl-s</I>) and, then,
* resume it (with <I>ctl-q</I>).  The moral is that <code>fairSelect</code> frees
* us from worries such as the speed of our <I>JVM</I> and its scheduling behaviour.
* <P>
* Sometimes, of course, we need to use <code>priSelect</code> to impose a <I>specific</I>
* (as opposed to <I>fair</I>) choice that overcomes the external scheduling of events.
* For example, if we were concerned that the timeout in <code>FairPlexTime</code> should
* be responded to <I>immediately</I> and unconcerned about the fair servicing of its
* channels, we could put its <code>CSTimer</code> as the first element of its <code>Guard</code>
* array and use a <code>priSelect</code>.
*
* <H3><A NAME="STFR">A Simple Traffic Flow Regulator</H3>
* The <code>Regulate</code> process controls the flow of traffic from its <code>in</code> to
* <code>out</code> channels.  It produces a constant rate of output flow, regardless of
* the rate of its input.  At the end of each timeslice defined by the required output
* rate, it outputs the last object input during that timeslice.  If nothing has come
* in during a timeslice, the previous output will be repeated (note: this will be a
* <code>null</code> if nothing has ever arrived).  If the input flow is greater than
* the required output flow, data will be discarded.
* <P>
* The interval (in msecs) defining the output flow rate is given by a constructor
* argument; but it can be reset at any time by sending a new interval (as a <code>Long</code>)
* down the <code>reset</code> channel.
* <P>
* <I> Note: this example shows how simple it is to program time-regulated functionality
* like that performed by </I><code>java.awt.Component.repaint</code><I>.</I>

* <P>
* Contrast the above programming of the canteen as a CSP <I>process</I> rather
* than a <I>monitor</I>.  A monitor cannot refuse a callback when noone has the lock,
* even though it may not be in a state to process it.  In the above, a <code>supply</code>
* <I>method</I> would have to cope with its being called when there is no room to take the supply.
* A <code>request</code> <I>method</I> would have to be dealt with even though there may be no chickens
* to deliver.  Monitors manage such problems by putting their callers on hold
* (<code>wait</code>), but that means that their methods have to rely on each other to get
* out of any resulting embarassment (using <code>notify</code>).
* And that means that the logic of those methods has to be tightly coupled, which
* makes reasoning about them hard.  This gets worse the more interdependent methods
* the monitor has.
* <P>
* On the other hand, the above <code>Canteen</code> <I>process</I> simply refuses service on
* its <code>supply</code> and <code>request</code> <I>channels</I> if it can't cope, leaving
* the supplying or requesting processes waiting harmlessly on those channels.
* The service responses can assume their run-time set <I>pre-conditions</I> and have
* independent -- and trivial -- logic.  When circumstances permit,
* the blocked processes are serviced in the normal way.
* </P>
* <H2>Implementation Footnote</H2>
* This <code>Alternative</code> class and the various channel classes
* (e.g. {@link One2OneChannel}) are mutually dependent monitors -- they see instances
* of each other and invoke each others' strongly interdependent methods.  This logic
* is inspired by the published algorithms and data structures burnt into the microcode
* of the <I>transputer</I> some 15 years ago (1984).  Getting this logic <I>`right'</I>
* in the context of Java monitors is something we have done <code>(n + 1)</code> times,
* only to find it flawed <code>n</code> times with an unsuspected race-hazard months
* (sometimes years) later.  Hopefully, we have it <I>right</I> now ... but a proof
* of correctness is really needed!
* </P>
* To this end, a formal (CSP) model of Java's monitor primitives
* (the <code>synchronized</code> keyword and the <code>wait</code>, <code>notify</code> and
* <code>notifyAll</code> methods of the <code>Object</code> class) has been built.
* This has been used for the <I>formal verification</I> of the JCSP implementation
* of channel <code>read</code> and <code>write</code>, along with the correctness of
* <I>2-way</I> channel input <code>Alternative</code>s.
* Details and references are listed under
* <A HREF="http://www.cs.ukc.ac.uk/projects/ofa/jcsp/index.html#Model"><I>`A CSP Model
* for Java Threads'</I> on the JCSP web-site</A>.
* [The proof uses the <A HREF="http://www.formal.demon.co.uk/FDR2.html">FDR</A>
* model checker.  Model checkers do not easily allow verification of results containing
* free variables - such as the correctness of the <I>n-way</I> <code>Alternative</code>.
* An investigation of this using <I>formal transformation</I> of one system of CSP equations
* into another, rather than <I>model checking</I> is being considered.]
* <P>
* The <I>transputer</I> designers always said that getting its microcoded scheduler
* logic right was one of their hardest tasks.  Working directly with the monitor
* concept means working at a similar level of difficulty for application programs.
* One of the goals of JCSP is to protect users from ever having to work at that level,
* providing instead a range of CSP primitives whose ease of use scales well with
* application complexity -- and in whose implementation those monitor complexities
* are correctly distilled and hidden.
